# Online Code Submission and Execution Platform üíª

Welcome to the Online Code Submission and Execution Platform! This project implements a web-based platform using the Django framework to facilitate online code submission and execution. Inspired by platforms like LeetCode, it allows users to test their code against provided test cases, view execution time and memory usage, and receive immediate feedback on the correctness of their solutions.

## Features üöÄ

- **Code Submission and Execution**: Users can submit their code through a web interface and execute it on the platform.
- **Test Case Evaluation**: The platform evaluates the submitted code against predefined test cases, providing instant feedback on its correctness.
- **Custom Input Support**: Users can input custom test cases to further test their solutions.
- **Execution Time Tracking**: Utilizes Django's template language to display execution time alongside the output.
- **Memory Usage Monitoring**: Tracks memory usage using the `tracemalloc` module to help users optimize their code.
- **Error Suggestions**: Provides suggestions for fixing errors in the code by highlighting the particular section where the mistake is located.
- **User Experience Enhancement**: Utilizes Bootstrap CSS and jQuery to improve the appearance and functionality of the platform's HTML template.
- **Result Display**: Upon execution, users are presented with a screen indicating whether their code passed all test cases or not.
