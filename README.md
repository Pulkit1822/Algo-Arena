## Project Overview

Algo Arena is a comprehensive platform for competitive programming and algorithm development. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to solve problems based on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The platform includes a frontend for problem listings, problem details, code submission, and result display, as well as an online judge system that evaluates submitted code against test cases and provides instant feedback on correctness.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
  - **CSS**: For styling the web pages.
  - **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity to the web pages.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS framework to style the application.
  - **Vite**: For fast and optimized development build.

- **Backend**:
  - **Python**: The primary programming language used for the backend.
  - **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the online judge system.
  - **SQLite**: A lightweight database used for storing user submissions and problem data.
  - **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework used for styling the web pages.
  - **Monaco Editor**: A code editor that provides a rich coding experience for users.

## Key Features

- **Code Submission and Execution**: Users can submit their code through a web interface and execute it on the platform.
- **Test Case Evaluation**: The platform evaluates the submitted code against predefined test cases, providing instant feedback on its correctness.
- **Custom Input Support**: Users can input custom test cases to further test their solutions.
- **Execution Time Tracking**: Utilizes Django's template language to display execution time alongside the output.
- **Memory Usage Monitoring**: Tracks memory usage using the `tracemalloc` module to help users optimize their code.
- **Error Suggestions**: Provides suggestions for fixing errors in the code by highlighting the particular section where the mistake is located.
- **User Experience Enhancement**: Utilizes Bootstrap CSS and jQuery to improve the appearance and functionality of the platform's HTML template.
- **Result Display**: Upon execution, users are presented with a screen indicating whether their code passed all test cases or not.
- **Monaco Editor**: Implemented the Monaco editor for better Python language readability and an enhanced code editing experience.
- **Dark Mode**: Added a dark mode facility for reducing eye strain and improving usability in low-light environments.
- **Responsive UI**: Enhanced the UI to be more responsive, providing a better experience on various devices.
